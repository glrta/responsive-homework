Didn't have enough time this week to revise or even to merge css pages in a single document... but managed to link to 'about' page :)

#Questions
The CSS is organised in sections. This helped me in the process, but I wonder if it is too unusual. 

The layout was created with % rather than absolute pixels. It gave me more control of the overall layout. Am I losing on anything for not using pixels?

#Difficult
I struggled with 'read more's. I have managed to place them where I wanted, but they take up the whole line. I'd prefer it with a concise widht. 

#Enjoyable
Flex is still confusing, but I really enjoyed playing around with it and putting the pieces of the jigsaw together.
